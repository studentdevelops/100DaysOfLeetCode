### Test Cases
```
Input: n = 6
Output: true
Explanation: 6 = 2 Ã— 3
```
```

Output: true
Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.
```
```
Input: n = 14
Output: false
Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes the prime factor 7.

### Constraints 
* `-2^31 <= n <= 2^31 - 1`

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isUgly(int n) {
      if (n <= 0) {
            return false;
        }
        
        while (n % 2 == 0) {
            n /= 2;
        }
        while (n % 3 == 0) {
            n /= 3;
        }
        while (n % 5 == 0) {
            n /= 5;
        }
        
        return n == 1;
    }
